## Overview
Welcome!

You can call me TJ, I am a React developer with a background in web design, strategic marketing, and analytics at high-tech startups.

In 2017 I graduated magna cum laude from Babson College with dual-concentrations in business analytics and marketing. I have extensive professional experience working in highly collaborative environments (both in-person and remotely) plus a proven track record in project management, organization & prioritization, logistics, and creative problem solving that I am eager to bring to your development team.

I've logged over 2,000 development hours including General Assembly's intensive 24-week, 450+ hour full-stack software engineering immersive program focused on product development fundamentals, object-oriented programming, MVC frameworks, data modeling, and team collaboration strategies

Please take some time to check out my projects and reach out to learn more about me and my work!
